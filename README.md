Computer product catalog system API.

Team: SÃ¡vio Allan da Silva Moura and Vitor Oliveira Ropke

Project: A computer product catalog system that allows you to create, view, update and delete information about products in a catalog. Users can add new products, view details of existing products, update information (such as price or description), and remove products from the catalog.

Justification: Help a store control its inventory more easily compared to non-digital means.

This repository contains only the backend system. This is like a server that communicates with the database and handles the data. The frontend is at this link: https://github.com/vitorropke/computer-product-catalog-front
